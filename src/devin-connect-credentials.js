/**
 * DEVIN_CONNECT credential store — encrypted email/password at rest.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the DEVIN_CONNECT session token (account.apiKey,
 * `devin-session-token$<JWT>`) is an opaque server-side session_id with NO
 * expiry claim and NO refresh path (Auth1 login returns hasRefresh:false). When
 * the server retires that session_id, the account goes permanently 'error' with
 * no recovery — a single point of failure for the whole DEVIN_CONNECT surface.
 *
 * The ONLY way to mint a fresh session token is a full email/password Auth1
 * login (windsurfLogin). So to auto-recover, we must hold the password. This
 * module keeps those credentials encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM under a key
 * derived from the operator-supplied DEVIN_CONNECT_CRED_KEY.
 *
 * SECURITY POSTURE:
 *   - OFF by default: no DEVIN_CONNECT_CRED_KEY → store is disabled, nothing is
 *     written or read. Auto-relogin simply never triggers.
 *   - Key never touches disk; only the AES-GCM ciphertext + per-record salt/iv
 *     /authTag are persisted (accounts.creds.json, gitignored).
 *   - Plaintext passwords are NEVER logged. Callers reference records by email.
 *   - Tampering or a wrong key fails closed (GCM auth tag mismatch → throw).
 *
 * File shape (accounts.creds.json):
 *   { "v": 1, "records": { "<email-lower>": { salt, iv, tag, ct } } }   (all hex)

// ─── The store lock: a permanent sentinel plus unique claim INSTANCES ───────
//
//   <store>.lock            permanent sentinel at the fixed pre-v2 path:
//                             • a regular file — a fresh store
//                             • a directory holding format.json — a migrated one
//   <store>.lock.claims/    retained coordination directory
//     claim-<host>-<pid>-<token>/     one immutable claim per writer
//
// WHY THE SENTINEL IS A FILE FOR A FRESH STORE. <store>.lock used to be a
// directory that had to be created and then stamped, so a failure between those
// two steps (crash, ENOSPC) left a lock nothing could read and every later save
// was fenced forever (2026-09-17 review, P2). The sentinel is now published by
// hard-linking a fully prepared file: the path is either absent or complete, and
// there is no window in which a created-but-uninitialized lock exists. A pre-v2
// writer cannot take the path either — its mkdir fails on an existing path, and
// its release rmdir cannot remove a file — so after the first new-format writer
// no pre-v2 writer can hold this lock again (its own reclaim then finds no
// owner.json and refuses).
//
// WHY A PRE-V2 DIRECTORY IS KEPT, NEVER RENAMED AND NEVER EMPTIED. An old-version
// reclaimer may still be running: it reads the stamp, judges the owner dead,
// pauses, then deletes by PATH. If this code renamed or removed that directory —
// or left it empty — the paused reclaimer would delete whatever replaced it,
// which is exactly the P1 this change removes. So the directory stays at its path
// forever: the migrator first holds a uniquely named guard INSIDE it (an old
// reclaimer's rmdir then fails with ENOTEMPTY even after it unlinks the stamp)
// and only ever installs a permanent format.json inside it. A directory without
// that marker is refused however old it looks: a paused pre-v2 writer between its
// mkdir and its stamp is indistinguishable from a leftover, and elapsed time is
// not proof of death.
//
// CLAIMS ARE INSTANCES. The identity IS the directory name (host, pid, random
// token), so a reclaim can only delete the exact instance whose writer it proved
// dead by ESRCH on this host; claim and release both name an instance rather than
// a shared path. The claims directory is read AFTER this writer's claim exists:
// two writers can both be past their read only if each missed the other's claim,
// which requires the second claim to be created after the first read — but then
// the second read is later still and sees the first claim. A live claim is never
// removed, so the loser reads BUSY.
//
// LIMITS, stated rather than implied: only ESRCH on this host proves a pid is
// gone, so a recycled pid — and any foreign host — stays conservatively BUSY until
// an operator removes that instance; worker threads share a pid, so a claim is per
// process, not per thread; a pre-v2 directory left empty by a crash between mkdir
// and stamp is an explicitly irrecoverable legacy boundary (refused, operator
// action required); and this trusts local-filesystem readdir/mkdir/link
// visibility, the same assumption the old mkdir-based lock already made.
