// queue-on-pin: wait briefly for your OWN account instead of rotating to a substitute.
//
// Rotating away from a sticky pin costs a full prompt-cache WRITE on the substitute, and
// the pin does not come back: the success path re-pins whatever served, and there is no
// return-home mechanism. Measured over 6 blocked turns, distinct accounts touched (each
// one a full-prefix write; a write is ~5.6x a read, derived from devin-connect.js's "hit
// cost measured at 17.8% of miss" — NOT from the tag-4 A/B token counts, which pin which
// tag carries cache-write and say nothing about cost):
//
//     rotate and re-pin (default)     2
//     keep the pin but rotate anyway  4     ← SCATTERS, measured and reverted
//     queue-on-pin                    1
//
// Waiting is the only one that stays on a single account. It is nonetheless OFF by
// default (`stickyQueueOnPinMs = 0`), because waiting caps that caller's throughput at
// ONE account's RPM (pro 60/min, unprobed 20/min) where rotating spreads it across the
// pool. Cost-versus-latency is an operator's call, so the knob picks.
//
// The two properties that make it safe are tested here as hard as the happy path:
//   * it only ever waits when the pinned account's OWN retryAfterMs fits the budget, so
//     an hours-long quota dry-well rotates immediately instead of stalling;
//   * a poll is free — no hit/miss stat, no LRU reorder, no clear on a miss. Otherwise
//     every queued turn would corrupt the numbers an operator reads.
